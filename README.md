# Cryptography-using-Hill-Cipher-method

This project implements the **Hill Cipher algorithm** for encrypting and decrypting text using matrix operations in Python. It is a classical cipher that uses linear algebra concepts to secure messages.

## What is Hill Cipher?

The **Hill Cipher** is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It takes a group of letters and encrypts them using a matrix multiplication modulo 26.

- Uses a **key matrix** (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3)
- Only works when the matrix is **invertible modulo 26**

## Features

- Encryption of plaintext using Hill Cipher
- Decryption using matrix inverse
- Clean modular Python code
- User input support for plaintext and key
- Handles basic validation (e.g., key invertibility)
